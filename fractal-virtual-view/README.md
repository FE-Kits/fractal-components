# About

## Motivation & Credits

- [react-virtual-list #Project#](https://github.com/developerdizzle/react-virtual-list): Super simple virtualized list React component

- [react-virtual-draggable-grid #Project#](https://github.com/twils0/react-virtual-draggable-grid): react-virtual-draggable-grid is a heavily customizable, virtual, and draggable grid component. RVDG was inspired by the structure of react-motion, though it runs on pure CSS (inline styles) under the hood. In addition, it's only about 9 KB, when gzipped.
