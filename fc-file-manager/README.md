# About

## Motivation & Credits

- [el-file #Project#](https://github.com/mflorence99/el-file):  The Elf file manager is the latest. My motivation throughout has partly been that few Linux tools have the kind of rich UI you can build today with tools like Angular and Material Design.

- [electron-quasar-file-explorer #Project#](https://github.com/hawkeye64/electron-quasar-file-explorer): A Simple File Explorer using Vue/Quasar/Electron

- [JumpFm #Project#](https://jumpfm.org/#Builtin%20Super-Powers): A file manager that lets you jump.

- [filemanager #Project#](https://github.com/OpusCapita/filemanager): React based FileManager for browser ( + FS REST API for Node.js and Express)
